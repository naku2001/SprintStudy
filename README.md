# Njere — AI Study Companion

**Njere** means *Wisdom* in Shona. The name feels right because the whole point of this app is to take a wall of academic text and turn it into something you can actually learn from.

Upload a PDF or a text file, and Njere reads it, breaks it into chunks, embeds each chunk with Google Gemini, stores everything in Pinecone, then streams a structured summary back to you — key takeaways, topic flow, review questions and all. It's built to feel fast and to stay out of your way.

---

## What it does right now

- **Smart summarization** — drop in a `.pdf` or `.txt`, get a clean structured summary streamed back in real time. No waiting for the full thing to generate before you see anything.
- **Persistent library** — every note you summarize gets chunked, embedded, and stored in Pinecone. Your library builds up over time.
- **Re-summarize anytime** — stored notes can be re-summarized without re-uploading the file. The chunks live in Pinecone with their metadata, so we just pull them back and run the model again.
- **Note detail view** — you can inspect individual chunks and see the embedding vector previews for any stored note.

## What's being built

- **Flashcards** *(35% done)* — auto-generate Anki-style active recall cards from your summaries. Q&A pairs and spaced repetition are part of the plan too.
- **Performance tracking** — keep tabs on what you've reviewed, what you're weak on, and how your retention is improving over time.

## Getting started

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/njere.git
cd njere
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your keys:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_key_here
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=sprintstudy-main
PINECONE_NAMESPACE=default
PINECONE_CLOUD=aws
PINECONE_REGION=us-east-1
EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=768
```

### 2. Run the backend

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
python backend/main.py
# → running on http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# → running on http://localhost:3000
```

The Vite dev server automatically proxies all `/api/*` requests to the Flask backend, so you don't need to touch CORS or configure anything.

## API reference

| Method | Endpoint | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/study-notes/summarize-stream` | Upload a file, get a streaming SSE summary |
| `GET` | `/api/study-notes` | List all stored notes |
| `GET` | `/api/study-notes/:id` | Get chunks + embedding preview for one note |
| `POST` | `/api/study-notes/:id/resummarize-stream` | Re-summarize from stored Pinecone chunks |
| `DELETE` | `/api/study-notes/:id` | Delete note — removes Pinecone vectors + local file |

Streaming endpoints emit `event: status`, `event: meta`, `event: token`, and `event: done` SSE events. The frontend consumes these to render the summary progressively as it arrives.

## A note on the Pinecone index

If you already have a Pinecone index under the same name with a different dimension (e.g. 1024 from a previous project), the app will detect the mismatch on startup, delete the old index, and recreate it at 768 dimensions. You'll lose whatever was in it, but since the dimension would've been incompatible anyway, there's nothing to save.
